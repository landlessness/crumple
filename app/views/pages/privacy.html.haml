%h1 Privacy Policy
%h2 Your privacy is critically important to us. 

%p At Crumple we have a few fundamental principles:

%ul
  %li We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  %li We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  %li We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  %li We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
  
%p Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

  Crumple LLC (“Crumple”) operates the website
  = link_to('crumpleapp.com', 'http://crumpleapp.com', :class => 'link') + '.'
  It is Crumple’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

%h3 Website Visitors
%p Like most website operators, Crumple collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Crumple’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Crumple’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Crumple may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

%p Crumple also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Crumple only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

%h3 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
%p Certain visitors to Crumple’s website choose to interact with Crumple in ways that require Crumple to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Crumple gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at crumpleapp.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with Crumple – by purchasing access to additional add-on services – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Crumple collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Crumple. Crumple does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

%h3 Aggregated Statistics
%p Crumple may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Crumple may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Crumple does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

%h3 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
%p Crumple discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Crumple’s behalf or to provide services available at Crumple’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Crumple’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Crumple will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Crumple discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Crumple believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Crumple, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Crumple website and have supplied your email address, Crumple may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up-to-date with what’s going on with Crumple and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Crumple takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

%h3 Cookies
%p A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Crumple uses cookies to help Crumple identify and track visitors, their usage of Crumple website, and their website access preferences. Crumple visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Crumple’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Crumple’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

%h3 Ads
%p Ads appearing on any of our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Crumple and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

%h3 Privacy Policy Changes
%p Although most changes are likely to be minor, Crumple may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Crumple’s sole discretion. Crumple encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
