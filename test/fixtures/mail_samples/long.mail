<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Look at any app in iTunes.  You'll see something like this:
<br/>
<br/>   Reviews for current version: 0
<br/>   Reviews for all versions: 1,783
<br/>
<br/>With this information, you should be able to deduce the answer.  ;)

<br/>Hi TL,
<br/>
<br/>&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/>Your app&#8217;s reviews will remain, but
<br/>iTunes (desktop) will only display the written reviews for your latest
<br/>(current) version.&nbsp; However, the user can click on &#8220;All Ver=
sions&#8221;
<br/>to see all the written reviews.&nbsp; The App Store mobile app will di=
splay all written
<br/>reviews across all versions in reverse chronological order.
<br/>
<br/>&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/>To the best of my knowledge, reviews do
<br/>not contribute to the algorithm used to determine rank in the App Stor=
e.&nbsp; I
<br/>believe this is calculated by a 24-hour rolling average of downloads (=
source: http://www.slideshare.net/pinchmedia/iphone-appstore-secrets-pinch-=
media).
<br/>
<br/>&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/>Hope this helps,
<br/>

<br/>    QUESTION&gt; Are there tested ways to secure mobile apps? Looking
<br/>    for Objective-C etc. functions/libraries.
<br/>   =20
<br/>    1. Proposed home made DRM system
<br/>    - encrypted cookies
<br/>    - verifying purchase with a server when connection is available
<br/>    (little data or can do over WiFi to not hurt customers' cap) -
<br/>    similar to Win7/Office annual subscriptions...
<br/>    Does anyone know of any lightweight app DRM or would like to
<br/>    cooperate on that?
<br/>   =20
<br/>    2. Native Apps internal DRM? It seems from the&nbsp; IPhone/iPad
<br/>    App Piracy thread that even native apps lose out in sales.=20
<br/>    From the discussion, native apps can include a DRM in it to tighte=
n
<br/>    up stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
<br/>   =20
<br/>    3. Security for Web Mobile Apps. Apple really doesn't care
<br/>    about web apps - but I don't think all web apps should be "free". =
If
<br/>    a DRM could be integrated into these next-generation HTML5 apps ..=
.
<br/>    there could be scope for a paid model for portable Web apps.&nbsp;
<br/>    Especially corporations for in-house (intranet web?) apps would li=
ke
<br/>    some kind of security.
<br/>   =20
<br/>    What do you guys think?
<br/>   =20
<br/>    ---- Phillip Jain
<br/>    CTO, ConsAid, Inc.
<br/>   =20
<br/>    PS. Since our corporate DNA is web-apps, we are skipping the nativ=
e
<br/>    iPhone SDK,etc. and moving on to the next-generation of HTML5 Web
<br/>    Apps that doesn't require going through the app store or making
<br/>    native apps. It is not the 30% that bothers, but the whole overhea=
d
<br/>    of training or hiring platform specific developers is a mess. This
<br/>    is similar to the freemium model for web apps, where even if 1-2%
<br/>    "subscribe" it pays off. While the best apps will always be Native
<br/>    apps, it is also hard to deal with popular lifetimes of a few
<br/>    months.=20
<br/>   =20
<br/>    PPS. Some people will object that is where e.g. the Sony Rootkit, =
or
<br/>    the whole Macrovision/Intuit fiascos etc. got started. I think it =
is
<br/>    different for "little companies" vs. huge recording studios. We
<br/>    little app developers can greatly benefit from the 4%-16%-80%
<br/>    solution. In other words 80% will copy if they can do it easily. W=
e
<br/>    only need a way to handle them and hopefully the 16%. While the 4%
<br/>    (or rather 0.1%) will always hack/crack it!

<br/>I guess I don&#39;t know enough of the Hindi script to notice the diff=

<br/>
<br/>Can you give an example? (a screen shot highlighting a good rendering =
